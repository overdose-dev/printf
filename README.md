printf
C - printf printf is the C language function to do format-ted printing. In the most simple case,printf takes one argument:a string of characters to be printe. This string iscomposed of characters, each of which is printed ex-actly as it appears. So printf("xyz");would sim-ply print an x, then a y, and ﬁnally az. This is notexactly “formatted” printing, but it is still the basisof what printf does.
